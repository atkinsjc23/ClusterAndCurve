Cluster and Curve Scores.

The purpaose of this repository is to cluster and curve scores in a way such that a score in one cluster is at least a
fixed value away from the minimum score of a higher cluster. The motivation for this repository is to minimize the 
number of potential emails and office visits of students at the end of the semester trying to make their case for a higher
grade. Some might call this cynical, but I prefer to call it proactive.
